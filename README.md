Agentic AI project- Recipe Preparation Agent
# ðŸ§  Recipe Preparation AI Agent (IBM Watsonx.ai - Lite Plan)

This is a smart **AI assistant** that helps users prepare recipes using only the ingredients they have on hand. Built using **IBM Watsonx.ai** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities, this project demonstrates how to use AI agents to reduce food waste and make cooking easier.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Accepts a **list of ingredients** as input
- Suggests **complete recipes** using those ingredients
- Provides **step-by-step instructions**
- Suggests **ingredient substitutions** if something is missing
- Offers **dietary tips** (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- Runs entirely on IBM Cloud (Lite plan supported)

## ðŸ›  How to Build This Project

### 1. Create Project in IBM Watsonx.ai
- Go to [IBM Watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/)
- Create a new **Empty Project**
- Choose **Lite Plan**
- Name it: `RecipePreparationAgent`
- Attach IBM Cloud Object Storage (free tier)

### 2. Add an AI Agent
- Go to the **Assets** tab
- Click **Agent â†’ Build an AI agent to automate tasks**
- Name it: `SmartRecipeBot`

### 3. Setup Instructions
In the `Setup` tab, paste the following:

You are a helpful recipe assistant.
The user will enter only a list of ingredients. Based on this list, suggest one recipe that uses those ingredients. Provide:

1. A short recipe name
2. Step-by-step instructions
3. Any substitutions for missing common items
4. Cooking tips, if needed

Be brief and use only the ingredients given by the user. If a full recipe is not possible, suggest a simple snack or partial dish.


### 4. Add Recipe Knowledge (Optional)
- Go to the **Knowledge** tab
- Upload a `.txt` file of example recipes (optional but improves output quality)

### 5. Test Your Agent
- Go to **Preview** tab
